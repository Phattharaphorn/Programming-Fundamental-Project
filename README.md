# Programming Project 
Programming Project (01076104), Computer Engineering 60 at KMITL.

- This repository is the Shooter Rainjerr Game project. To develop this project, class such as Player, Score, Menu, Game Over, Item, and Anemy were created, which are designed to call C++ components to create games. Using SFML helps with graphics rendering, input management, sound work, screen management, and timing management to create games in C++ more easily.
